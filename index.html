    <p>To build websites, you should know about HTML — the fundamental technology used to define the structure of a webpage. HTML is used to specify whether your web content should be recognized as a paragraph, list, heading, link, image, multimedia player, form, or one of many other available elements or even a new element that you define.</p>

      <p>Ideally, you should start your learning journey by learning HTML. Start by reading Introduction to HTML. You may then move on to learning about more advanced topics such as:</p>
    <ul>
      
      <li>CSS, and how to use it to style HTML (for example alter your text size and fonts used, add borders and drop shadows, layout your page with multiple columns, add animations and other visual effects.)</li><br>
      
      <li>JavaScript, and how to use it to add dynamic functionality to web pages (for example find your location and plot it on a map, make UI elements appear/disappear when you toggle a button, save users' data locally on their computers, and much much more.)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Before starting this topic, you should have at least basic familiarity with using computers and using the web passively (i.e. just looking at it, consuming the content). You should have a basic work environment set up as detailed in Installing basic software, and understand how to create and manage files, as detailed in Dealing with files — both are parts of our Getting started with the web complete beginner's module.</p>
    
    <p>It is recommended that you work through Getting started with the web before attempting this topic, however, it isn't absolutely necessary; much of what is covered in the HTML basics article is also covered in our Introduction to HTML module, albeit in a lot more detail.</p>

        <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language; it is a markup language used to tell your browser how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wishes it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a bit of content into a hyperlink to link to another page on the web, italicize words, and so on.  For example, take the following line of content:</p>
        <code>
          My cat is very grumpy
        </code>
        
        <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph(&lt;p&gt;) element:</p>
        <code>
          &lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;
        </code>
        
        
        <p>Here are more examples of html code:</p>
        <pre>
        <code>
        &lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;
        </code>
        </pre>
        
            <pre>
              <code>
              &lt;h2&gt;It's Lit!&lt;/h2&gt;
                </code>
             </pre>
        
          <pre>
            <code>
            &lt;h3&gt;Wash your hands!&lt;/h3&gt;
              </code>
           </pre>
        
        <h4>The main parts of an element are:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>The opening tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the start of the paragraph is.</p>
            </li>
          
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>The closing tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the end of the paragraph is. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error and can lead to strange results.</p>
           </li>
          
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element, which in this case is just text.</p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>The element:</b> The opening tag plus the closing tag plus the content equals the element. </p>
          </li>
          </ul>

    <p>This topic contains the following modules, in a suggested order for working through them. You should definitely start with the first one.</p>
    
    <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>
<p>This module sets the stage, getting you used to important concepts and syntax, looking at applying HTML to text, how to create hyperlinks, and how to use HTML to structure a webpage.</p>
    
    <h2>Multimedia and embedding</h2>
<p>This module explores how to use HTML to include multimedia in your web pages, including the different ways that images can be included, and how to embed video, audio, and even entire other webpages.</p>
    
    <h2>HTML Tables</h2>
<p>Representing tabular data on a webpage in an understandable, accessible way can be a challenge. This module covers basic table markup, along with more complex features such as implementing captions and summaries.</p>

    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) on MDN
The main entry point for HTML documentation on MDN, including detailed element and attribute references — if you want to know what attributes an element has or what values an attribute has, for example, this is a great place to start.</p>
